## SLSN-bol


This repository contains scripts and results of work devoted to the processing of photometric observations of superpowerful supernovae presented in the open catalog of supernovae. To approximate multicolor light curves, vector Gaussian processes implemented in . Then, using the obtained continuous curves, the bolometric light curves were calculated using the least squares method in the black body approximation.
