## SLSN-bol


This repository contains scripts and results of work devoted to processing of photometric observations of superluminous supernovae presented in the Open Supernova Catalog. Multicolor light curves was approximated by vector Gaussian processes implemented in \url{https://gp.snad.space/}. Then bolometric light curves in the black body approximation were calculated using obtained continuous light curves and the least squares method.
